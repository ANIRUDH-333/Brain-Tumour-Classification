# Brain-Tumour-Classification
Based on the concept of SVD, the state of brain is determined (Normal or Abnormal) based on the tumor present in the brain.

# Usage

## Dataset_Test
In this folder, 30+ images of Brain Tumor are present which would help us to predict the Brain tumor and test our code

## Code
This is the folder which contains the main code. Here we have 2 files. Put both of these files together in a single folder.
### btp.fig
This is just an outline figure of what we get after excuting the matlab code i.e this helps in modifying the properties of figure window.
### btp.m
This is the main code file in .m extension. This contains different function as a script which needs to be executed.
#### Steps to get output
1. Click on Run after opening the file btp.m
2. Click load img on the figure window opened after running.
3. Select a figure that needs to be predicted
4. Press the predict button to see whether the loaded image is normal or abnormal.
